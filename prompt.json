Make sure all necessary imports are done, and that your full code is enclosed with tsx``` blocks. Answer with generated code only, DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA TEXT DESCRIPTION OR COMMENTS BESIDES THE CODE. YOUR ANSWER CONTAINS CODE ONLY ! COMPONENT CODE ONLY !\r\nImportant:\r\n\r\n- DO NOT USE LIBRARIES OR IMPORTS OUTSIDE OF WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THIS TASK; otherwise it would crash the component because not installed. DO NOT IMPORT EXTRA LIBRARIES BESIDES WHAT IS PROVIDED ABOVE!\r\n- DO NOT HAVE ANY DYNAMIC DATA! Components are meant to be working as is without supplying any variable to them when importing them ! ONLY WRITE A COMPONENT THAT RENDER DIRECTLY WITH PLACEHOLDERS AS DATA, COMPONENT NOT SUPPLIED WITH ANY DYNAMIC DATA.\r\n- Only write the code for the component; Do not write extra code to import it! The code will directly be stored in an individual React .tsx file, so make sure to provide a default export!!\r\n  Write the React component code as the creative genius and React component genius you are - with good ui formatting.\r\n  Make sure to use makeStyles shorthands correctly for styling purposes."
